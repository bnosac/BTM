# BTM - Biterm Topic Modelling for Short Text with R

This is an R package wrapping the C++ code available at https://github.com/xiaohuiyan/BTM for constructing a **Biterm Topic Model (BTM)**. This model models word-word co-occurrences patterns (e.g., biterms). 

> Topic modelling using biterms is particularly good for finding topics in short texts (as occurs in short survey answers or twitter data).

### Installation

This R package is on CRAN, just install it with `install.packages('BTM')`

### What

The Biterm Topic Model (BTM) is a word co-occurrence based topic model that learns topics by modeling word-word co-occurrences patterns (e.g., biterms)

- A biterm consists of two words co-occurring in the same context, for example, in the same short text window. 
- BTM models the biterm occurrences in a corpus (unlike LDA models which model the word occurrences in a document). 
- It's a generative model. In the generation procedure, a biterm is generated by drawing two words independently from a same topic `z`. In other words, the distribution of a biterm `b=(wi,wj)` is defined as: `P(b) = sum_k{P(wi|z)*P(wj|z)*P(z)}` where k is the number of topics you want to extract.
- Estimation of the topic model is done with the Gibbs sampling algorithm. Where estimates are provided for `P(w|k)=phi` and `P(z)=theta`.

### Example

```
library(udpipe)
library(BTM)
data("brussels_reviews_anno", package = "udpipe")

## Taking only nouns of Dutch data
x <- subset(brussels_reviews_anno, language == "nl")
x <- subset(x, xpos %in% c("NN", "NNP", "NNS"))
x <- x[, c("doc_id", "lemma")]

## Building the model
set.seed(321)
model  <- BTM(x, k = 3, beta = 0.01, iter = 1000, trace = 100)

## Inspect the model - topic frequency + conditional term probabilities

scores <- predict(model, newdata = x)
```

**Make a specific topic called the background**

```
# If you set background to TRUE
# The first topic is set to a background topic that equals to the empirical word distribution. 
# This can be used to filter out common words.
set.seed(321)
model  <- BTM(x, k = 5, beta = 0.01, background = TRUE, iter = 1000, trace = 100)
topicterms <- terms(model, top_n = 5)
topicterms
```

### Provide your own set of biterms

An interesting use case of this package is to 

- cluster based on parts of speech tags like nouns and adjectives which can be found in the text in the neighbourhood of one another
- cluster dependency relationships provided by NLP tools like udpipe (https://CRAN.R-project.org/package=udpipe)

This can be done by providing your own set of biterms to cluster upon. 

**Example clustering cooccurrences of nouns/adjectives**

```
library(data.table)
library(udpipe)
## Annotate text with parts of speech tags
data("brussels_reviews", package = "udpipe")
anno <- subset(brussels_reviews, language %in% "nl")
anno <- data.frame(doc_id = anno$id, text = anno$feedback, stringsAsFactors = FALSE)
anno <- udpipe(anno, "dutch", trace = 10)

## Get cooccurrences of nouns / adjectives and proper nouns
biterms <- as.data.table(anno)
biterms <- biterms[, cooccurrence(x = lemma, 
                                  relevant = upos %in% c("NOUN", "PROPN", "ADJ"),
                                  skipgram = 2), 
                   by = list(doc_id)]
                   
## Build the model
set.seed(123456)
x <- subset(anno, upos %in% c("NOUN", "PROPN", "ADJ"))
x <- x[, c("doc_id", "lemma")]
model <- BTM(x, k = 5, beta = 0.01, iter = 2000, background = TRUE, 
             biterms = biterms, trace = 100)
topicterms <- terms(model, top_n = 5)
topicterms
```

**Example clustering dependency relationships**

```
library(udpipe)
library(tm)
data("brussels_reviews", package = "udpipe")

## Do annotation on Dutch text
anno <- subset(brussels_reviews, language %in% "nl")
anno <- data.frame(doc_id = anno$id, text = anno$feedback, stringsAsFactors = FALSE)
anno <- udpipe(anno, "dutch", trace = 10)
anno <- cbind_dependencies(anno)

## Specify a set of relationships you are interested in (e.g. objects of a verb)
biterms <- subset(anno, !is.na(lemma_parent))
biterms <- subset(biterms, dep_rel %in% c("obj"))
biterms <- data.frame(doc_id = biterms$doc_id, 
                      term1 = biterms$lemma, 
                      term2 = biterms$lemma_parent,
                      cooc = 1, 
                      stringsAsFactors = FALSE)

## Remove terms not interested in and put in x terms such that frequency stats of terms can be used
exclude <- stopwords("nl")                      
biterms <- subset(biterms, !term1 %in% exclude & !term2 %in% exclude)
x <- rbind(data.frame(doc_id = biterms$doc_id, lemma = biterms$term1, stringsAsFactors = FALSE),
           data.frame(doc_id = biterms$doc_id, lemma = biterms$term2, stringsAsFactors = FALSE))
x <- subset(x, !lemma %in% exclude)

## Build the topic model
model <- BTM(data = x, 
             biterms = biterms, 
             k = 6, iter = 2000, background = FALSE, trace = 100)
topicterms <- terms(model, top_n = 5)
topicterms
```
